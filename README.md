## What is this all about!

Convention over Git is a straightforward approach for an automatic synchronization between Git remote repositories.
Absolutely separate remote repositories will begin behave as a single remote repository.

This approach uses well-known Git tools. It is because Git has an innate ability to do this. All we need to add is some convention.
