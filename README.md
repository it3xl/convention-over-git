# Convention-over-Git

This project stores a simple, but ready-to-use implementation.

Convention over Git is a straightforward approach for an automatic synchronization between Git remote repositories.
Absolutely separate remote repositories will begin behave as a single remote repository.

This approach uses well-known Git tools. It is because Git has an innate ability to do this. All we need to add is some convention.

Wait a minute. My logic scattered across many files and uses some extra stuff. I need some time to combine everything, cleanup and test.
So, I'm planning to publish code here till the end of this week 08 October 2017 or one week later.
