# Convention-over-Git

This project stores a simple but ready to use implementation.

Convention over Git is a straightforward approach for an automatic synchronization between Git remote repositories.
Absolutely separate remote repositories will begin behave as a single remote repository.

This approach uses well-known Git tools. It is because Git has an innate ability to do this. All we need to add is some convention.

Now I have logic scattered across many files and uses some extra stuff.
I'm planning to prepare and publish here a light version till the end of the week.
